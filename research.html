<h1>Research Interests</h1>

<p>
I am particularly interested in <strong>Statistical Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Bayesian modeling</strong>, and their real-world applications such as <em>financial modeling, causal inference</em>, and <em>decision-making under uncertainty</em>.
</p>

<p>
My current research focuses on integrating probabilistic models with interpretable learning frameworks, bridging traditional statistical theory with modern ML techniques.
