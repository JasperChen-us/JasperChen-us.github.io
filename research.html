<h1>Research Interests</h1>

<p>
I am interested in latent variable models, causal inference, and statistical machine learning. In particular, I enjoy exploring statistical theory, developing new methodologies, and creating efficient computational tools for analyzing high-dimensional and complex data, with potential applications in large-scale educational assessments, psychological measurement, and financial data.
